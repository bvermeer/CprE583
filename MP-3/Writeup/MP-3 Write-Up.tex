\section{Software Grayscale Conversion}
After getting acquainted with the build environment for the LEON processor, we dived into the \textit{frameloop.c} code to see how it works. First we started by examining the main function and dissecting how it works. The main function of \textit{frameloop.c} first sets up the environment by enabling the coprocessor, and configuring and enabling the SVGA controller. It primarily copies all (= NFRAMES) of the image frames from memory to the SVGA controller; it can do so via two modes: mode 1 and mode 2. After the completion of the transfer of all (= NFRAMES) image frames, it computes the Frame Per Second measure for the buffering process. \\

Next we looked at the two different modes that were present in \textit{frameloop.c} to determine what they did. Mode 1 merely copies the current image from memory to the controller without applying any filters. Mode 2 is much more involved than mode 1. In mode 2, a filter is applied to each frame being transferred from memory to the buffer in the controller. Currently, two RGB values are being computed for each image frame and an OR is performed between the two RGB values to obtain the final the image frame that will be sent to the controller.

\section{Hardware Coprocessor - Grayscale Conversion}
In this section we were asked to read through the code in \textit{coproc.vhd} and \textit{coproc\_core.vhd} and provide a description of how the controller sends data to the core. After reading over the code in \textit{coproc.vhd} it became apparent that the LEON processor was passing the entire program instruction to the coprocessor. From there the coprocessor parses the instruction and extracts the op-code and source and destination register addresses. After getting the source register addresses it pulls the data directly from these registers. Therefore, the coprocessor has direct access to the LEON processor's registers. \\

We based our hardware coprocessor for the grayscale conversion on the logic we used to implement the software grayscale conversion. Here is a hardware diagram for the coprocessor we designed:

	 \begin{figure}[H]
	 	\begin{center}
	 		\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../part5_files/Grayscale_coprocessor_dataflow.png}
	 		\caption{Hardware Grayscale Conversion Coprocessor Dataflow Diagram}
	 	\end{center}
	 \end{figure}

The structure for the hardware coprocessor ended up being fairly simple and easily parallelized. Because of these qualities we were able to make the coprocessor complete the operation in one clock cycle. Additionally, since we were able to output a 64-bit value from the coprocessor, we are able to process four individual pixels in that single clock cycle. Including the load and storing operations (for some reason we could only get the 32-bit load/store operations to work correctly) it would only take 5 clock cycles (assuming the load and store operations take one cycle each).

%   SECTION 4
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Hardware Coprocessor - Edge Detection}
In this section, the task given is to modify the coprocessor to be able to perform greyscale edge detection. In order to implement this ability correctly, some changes had to be made to the files \textit{coproc.h}, \textit{coproc.vhd}, and \textit{coproc\_core.vhd}. The changes to the files were to provide two new instructions, CP\_PRELOAD, and CP\_EDGE\_DETECT.\\

In order to increase throughput, and potentially accelerate the process, the conclusion was made that the best approach to performing edge detection is as follows. Since the laplacian edge detection operation performed on a pixel requires the values of the eight pixels that surround it, a design decision made was that edge detection will not be performed on the pixels on the edge of the screen.

	 \end{figure}

\subsection{Coprocessor Interface Instructions}
	The LDC - Load Coprocessor Register instruction loads a word (32-bits) from memory into a coprocessor register.\\
	
	The LDDC - Load Double Coprocessor Register instruction loads a double-word (64-bits) from memory into a coprocessor register pair.\\
	
	The STC - Store Coprocessor instruction stores the value of a coporcessor register into memory.\\
	
	The STDC - Store Double Coprocessor instruction stores the value of a coprocessory register pair (with consecutive odd and even addresses) into memory.\\
	
	The opcode for both the LD and ST class of operations is 11 but they are differentiated by their op3 value.\\
	
	The CPOP1 - Coprocessor Operate 8 bits (opcode + op3) to denote that the instruction needs to be executed on the coprocessor. The remaining 24 bits are used to signify the 2 source registers, 1 destination register and the operation to be performed. All the register addresses refer to the coprocessor registers.

\section{Software Edge Detection}

For this part, we created a new Mode 5 to implement the edge detection in software. In this mode, we first called the software implementation of the grayscale conversion and then applied the Laplacian edge detector on the image, going left to right and top to bottom. We implemented this using two nested for loops, with the inner one traversing across the columns and the inner one traversing across the rows.\\

Here is a screenshot of our performance results of the software edge detection:

	 		\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{../part6_files/Software_Laplace_edge_software_performance.png}
	 		\caption{Software Laplace Edge Detection Results}
	 	\end{center}
	 \end{figure}


%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	SECTION 5
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Hardware Coprocessor - Edge Detection}

For the hardware edge detection implementation, we added two new opcodes - CP\_PRELOAD and 

CP\_EDGE\_DETECT. In coproc\_core, we essentially implemented 3 shift registers each being 64-bits long. Using CP\_PRELOAD, we shift in the next pixels to be apply the Laplacian edge detection on. 

CP\_EDGE\_DETECT consists of two cycles. In the first cycle, it performs the internal shifting of the shift registers and in the next cycle, it performs the Laplacian edge detection computation. Since we have 64-bit (4 pixels) shift registers, we are able to compute the Laplacian value for two center pixels simultaneously.\\

We perform our grayscale conversion in line with the edge detection computation, unlike the software implementation in which we first converted all the images to grayscale and then performed the edge detection. With the hardware implementation we were able to observe a 2.75 speedup when compared to the software implementation of the edge detection algorithm.\\
