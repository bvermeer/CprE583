Due to a licensing bug with the Xilinx tools this eval 
license must be installed in the follow direcotry:

~/.Xilinx/Coregen/CoreLicenses/

If you do not have this path in your home directory (i.e. ~), 
then create this path using mkdir as follows.

cd ~
mkdir .Xilinx
cd .Xilinx
mkdir Corgen
cd Corgen
mkdir CoreLicenses


Next cp the following file to the CoreLicenses directory:

xps_ll_temac_soft_core_permanent_eval.lic

If you do not do this the tools will give errors stating you 
do not have a license for the temac core.
